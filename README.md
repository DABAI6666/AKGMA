### Pretraining Visual Knowledge Aligner

<!-- After you have successfully downloaded the Wikipedia files and placed them in the appropriate path, you could use the following code to perform VKA pretraining. -->
Before you start the pretraining for the visual knowledge aligner, you should place the downloaded `Wikipedia-Knowledge-2M` dataset in LLaVA/playground/knowledge_data directory.

Then you can use the following scripts for pretraining.

```shell
cd Code
export PYTHONPATH=path_to_current_dir
bash scripts/decoder_model/pretrain_knowledge.sh
```




#### Training EKA with LLMs (Optional)

Replace `pretrain_opt_adapter` with the save path of your pretrained EKA.

``` shell
bash scripts/knowledge/pretrain.sh
```


#### Fine-tune EKA on the Knowledge Data with LLM
Change the attribute `pretrain_knowledge_params_path` to the path where the parameters extracted in the previous stage are stored.

``` shell
bash scripts/knowledge_qa/llava_vka_qa.sh
```


Besides, after completing the training, you can use the [code](LLaVA/checkpoints/scripts/get_non_lora_trainables.py) to extract both trainable non-LoRA parameters and LoRA parameters from the checkpoints.

#### Fine-tune SCKA on the MsCoco

Finally, we used a two-stage training method when fine-tuning FKA.

``` shell

bash scripts/knowledge_ic/image_caption_stage2.sh
```


#### Evalution
``` shell

bash scripts/knowledge_ic/eval/caption_test.sh
```



```
